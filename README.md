# Cat Fact Generator

This project was created using TypeScript, React and Express.

It's a simple generator that shows a new cat picture and cat fact each time the 'generate' button is pressed. The cat pictures have been fetched from https://thecatapi.com/ and the facts have been scraped from https://www.mygavet.com/services/blog/50-cat-facts-you-probably-didnt-know. 

## How to run:

Clone the repo and run this in the directory:

    nvm use node
    npm install
    npm run start:server

In a second terminal window run:

    npm run build

The app will now be running on http://localhost:3000/ 

That's all :)
